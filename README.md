## Simple To-Do CLI App

This is a simple command-line interface (CLI) application for managing to-do tasks. It is written in C++, as part of my studies in data structures and algorithms.

![TODO CLI App running](https://github.com/lucasbazev/todo-cli/assets/60510370/344a7cd3-5e4f-4102-a3d1-fde8d4a5eb3e)


### Motivation

I created this CLI tool to address my need for a practical, easy, and fast way to track tasks, particularly those related to software development. This tool is designed to streamline task management directly from the command line, making it a breeze to stay organized and productive.
Also, I developed this app to practice what I've been learning in my studies. Building a practical project helps reinforce the concepts and techniques.

### Features

The current version of the app includes the following basic functions:
- Adding tasks
- Marking tasks as done
- Marking tasks as undone
- Removing tasks
- Clearing list
- Listing the current state of all tasks

### Future Plans

While the app currently doesn't store the data in a database, I plan to implement database storage in future versions. This will allow for more robust data management and persistence.

### Requirements

- C++ Compiler: Ensure you have a C++ compiler installed, such as g++ or clang++.

### Usage

To use the app, simply clone this repository and run the `run.sh` script:

```
git clone https://github.com/lucasbazev/todo-cli/
cd todo-cli
./run.sh
```

You're all set up! Follow the on-screen instructions to interact with the app and manage your to-do tasks.
