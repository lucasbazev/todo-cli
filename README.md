## Simple To-Do CLI App

This is a simple command-line interface (CLI) application for managing to-do tasks. It is written in C++, as part of my studies in data structures and algorithms.

### Motivation

I developed this app to practice what I've been learning in my studies. Building a practical project helps reinforce the concepts and techniques I've been studying.

### Features

The current version of the app includes the following basic functions:
- Adding tasks
- Marking tasks as completed
- Removing tasks
- Listing current state of all tasks

### Future Plans

While the app currently doesn't store the data in a database, I plan to implement database storage in future versions. This will allow for more robust data management and persistence.

### Usage

To use the app, simply compile the source code and run the executable:

```
clang++ todo.cpp -o todo && ./todo
```
or
```
g++ todo.cpp -o todo && ./todo
```

Follow the on-screen instructions to interact with the app and manage your to-do tasks.
